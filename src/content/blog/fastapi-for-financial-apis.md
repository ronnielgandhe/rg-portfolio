# FastAPI for Financial APIs

After building multiple financial APIs, FastAPI has emerged as my framework of choice. Here's why it excels for financial applications.

## Performance Characteristics

FastAPI's async capabilities and Pydantic validation provide the performance needed for real-time market data APIs while maintaining type safety.

## Type Safety Matters

In financial applications, data integrity is paramount. FastAPI's automatic validation through Pydantic ensures data quality at the API boundary.

## Real-Time Market Data Streaming

Implementing WebSocket endpoints for streaming market data with FastAPI is straightforward and performant. Connection management and backpressure handling are first-class concerns.

## Authentication and Rate Limiting

Financial APIs require robust authentication and rate limiting. Integration with JWT and custom middleware provides enterprise-grade security.

## Testing and Documentation

FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation and testing utilities make it easy to build and maintain production-grade financial APIs.

The combination of speed, type safety, and developer experience makes FastAPI ideal for financial technology.
