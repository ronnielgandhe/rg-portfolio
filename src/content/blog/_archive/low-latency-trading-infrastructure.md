# Building Low-Latency Trading Infrastructure

When milliseconds matter, every architectural decision becomes critical. This post explores the journey of building a low-latency trading infrastructure on AWS.

## The Challenge

High-frequency trading demands infrastructure that can process market data and execute trades in microseconds. Traditional cloud architectures introduce too much latency for this use case.

## Architecture Decisions

### Network Optimization
We leveraged AWS placement groups and enhanced networking to minimize inter-service latency. Every hop in the network path was scrutinized.

### Event-Driven Design
Using Lambda with provisioned concurrency and EventBridge for event routing, we achieved predictable performance characteristics while maintaining serverless benefits.

## Results

Through careful optimization of Lambda memory allocation, connection pooling, and strategic use of API Gateway, we reduced average latency by 75% while maintaining 99.9% uptime.

The key insight: premature optimization is the root of all evil, but in trading systems, every optimization matters.
