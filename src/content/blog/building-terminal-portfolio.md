# Building a Terminal Portfolio

Creating a portfolio that stands out while remaining functional is a constant challenge. After years of traditional layouts, I decided to build something that reflects my background in systems and infrastructure: a terminal-inspired portfolio.

## The Vision

The goal was simple: create a portfolio that feels like interacting with a well-crafted terminal application. Not cartoonish or overdone, but subtle and functional—something that would feel natural to developers and engineers.

## Technical Decisions

### Framework Choice
I chose Astro for its performance characteristics and React integration. The ability to ship minimal JavaScript while maintaining interactive components was crucial for the terminal functionality.

### Styling Philosophy
The design follows Apple's interface principles:
- Subtle animations that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Glass morphism effects for depth without distraction

### Terminal Implementation
The interactive terminal uses a simple chat interface pattern, but styled to feel authentic:
- Monospace typography for code blocks
- Proper shell prompt formatting
- Realistic window chrome with traffic light controls

## Challenges and Solutions

### Performance Optimization
Static generation handles most content, with server-side rendering only for the chat API. This keeps initial load times minimal while enabling rich interactions.

### Accessibility
Terminal interfaces can be challenging for screen readers. I implemented proper ARIA labels and ensured all functionality remains keyboard accessible.

### Mobile Experience
Adapting a desktop-centric interface for mobile required careful consideration of touch targets and responsive typography.

## Lessons Learned

Building a themed portfolio taught me the importance of restraint. The terminal aesthetic could easily become overwhelming, but keeping it subtle and functional creates a more professional impression.

The key is authenticity—the design should enhance rather than overshadow the content.
