# Factor Models Explained

Factor models are the backbone of modern quantitative finance. This post demystifies factor models and shows how to implement them for practical use.

## What Are Factor Models?

Factor models decompose asset returns into systematic (market) and idiosyncratic (asset-specific) components. This decomposition is crucial for risk management and alpha generation.

## Common Factor Models

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model
The classic extension of CAPM adds size and value factors to explain returns beyond market beta.

### Carhart Four-Factor Model
Adding momentum to Fama-French provides additional explanatory power for short-term return patterns.

### Custom Factor Models
Building proprietary factors based on market microstructure, sentiment, or other signals can provide edge.

## Implementation Details

Using pandas and statsmodels, we can estimate factor exposures and attribution. The key is handling data quality issues and ensuring statistical robustness.

## Risk Attribution

Factor models enable precise risk attribution, helping portfolio managers understand where returns come from and where risk is concentrated.

## Practical Applications

From risk budgeting to performance attribution to optimal portfolio construction, factor models are essential tools in the quantitative toolkit.
