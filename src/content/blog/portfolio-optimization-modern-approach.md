# Portfolio Optimization: A Modern Approach

Portfolio optimization has evolved far beyond Markowitz's mean-variance framework. This post explores modern techniques for constructing robust portfolios.

## Beyond Mean-Variance

While mean-variance optimization provides a solid foundation, real-world portfolios face challenges that require more sophisticated approaches.

## Risk Parity and Factor Models

Risk parity allocates capital based on risk contribution rather than dollar amount. Combined with factor models, this approach provides more stable portfolio characteristics.

## Implementation in Python

Using CVXPY for convex optimization and pandas for data manipulation, we can implement efficient portfolio optimization that accounts for:

- Transaction costs
- Position limits
- Factor exposure constraints
- Risk budgeting

## Backtesting Results

Comparing traditional mean-variance, risk parity, and hierarchical risk parity approaches across different market regimes reveals important insights about robust portfolio construction.

The code examples demonstrate practical implementation details often glossed over in academic papers.
