# DevPulse

A real-time GitHub activity dashboard that aggregates and visualizes development metrics across repositories and organizations. Built for teams that want to understand their development patterns and code quality trends.

## The Problem

Development teams lack real-time visibility into their collective activity. Traditional GitHub insights are delayed and don't provide the granularity needed for active sprint management.

## Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Data Pipeline
- WebSocket connections to GitHub API for live event streaming
- Redis pub/sub for event distribution across instances
- Custom metrics engine processing commits, PRs, and issues

### Visualization Layer
- D3.js for interactive time-series charts
- React components with TypeScript for type-safe UI
- Next.js for SSR and API routes

### Performance Optimization
- Incremental static regeneration for dashboard pages
- Edge caching with Vercel Edge Functions
- Optimistic UI updates for sub-100ms perceived latency

## Key Features

- **Live Activity Feed**: Real-time commit and PR activity across repos
- **Custom Metrics**: Track velocity, review time, and code churn
- **Team Analytics**: Identify bottlenecks and collaboration patterns
- **Slack Integration**: Push notifications for critical events

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- D3.js and Recharts for data visualization
- Redis for caching and pub/sub
- GitHub GraphQL API
- Deployed on Vercel Edge Network

## Challenges & Learnings

Rate limiting with GitHub's API required implementing intelligent batching and caching strategies. Building real-time features without sacrificing performance taught valuable lessons about WebSocket connection management and state synchronization.

The project showcases how modern web technologies can create enterprise-grade developer tools with excellent UX.
