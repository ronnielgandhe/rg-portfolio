## 5. BUILD STATUS

✅ **Build succeeds** with zero errors
✅ **All routes pre-rendered** correctly
✅ **Navigation links** work in all menus
✅ **Terminal aesthetic** consistent across pages
✅ **Prose styling** applied to projects and case studies

---

## 6. CONTENT QUALITY

### Projects (Waterloo Engineering Style)
- Real technical depth (code samples, architecture diagrams, metrics)
- Honest about challenges (look-ahead bias, race conditions, eventual consistency)
- Quantitative results (Sharpe ratios, latency, throughput)
- Lessons learned section (what worked, what didn't, what's next)

### Case Studies (Ivey Business Style)
- Strategic framing (business context + technical decisions)
- Decision analysis (criteria, alternatives, trade-offs)
- Real company data (Netflix 700+ services, Uber 2,200+ services, Spotify 3,000+ engineers)
- Management insights (when to adopt microservices, organizational design)

---

## 8. METRICS

### Content Volume
- **Projects**: 3 projects × ~2,000 words each = ~6,000 words

- **References**: Real case studies from company blogs, academic sources

---

## 9. BRAND ALIGNMENT

✅ **Terminal aesthetic** - All pages use Mac terminal styling
✅ **Glass morphism** - Consistent glass panels throughout
✅ **Monospace fonts** - Code/terminal text uses SF Mono
✅ **Green accents** - Terminal green (#10b981) for highlights
✅ **Dark theme** - All pages use dark background with light text

## 10. NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add "Download PDF" for case studies (business-school format)
- [ ] Add GitHub stars/forks count to project cards (via API)
- [ ] Add "Related Projects" section to case studies (e.g., Netflix → QuantTerminal microservices)
- [ ] Add search functionality across projects + case studies
- [ ] Add tags filtering (Architecture, Scale, ML, etc.)
- [ ] Add reading time estimates to projects
- [ ] Add "Discussion" section with email CTA

### Analytics to Track
- Most viewed project (likely QuantTerminal)
- Most viewed case study (likely Netflix or Spotify)
- Average time on page (target: 5+ min for projects, 8+ min for cases)
- Bounce rate from projects page (target: <30%)

---

## DEPLOYMENT

Run these commands to deploy:

```bash
# Build and verify
npm run build

# Check for errors
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i error

# Start dev server to preview
npm run dev

# If satisfied, push to main (triggers Vercel deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "Revamp projects & add case studies section"
git push origin feature/projects-revamp
```

---

## CONCLUSION

This revamp transforms the portfolio from a generic project showcase into a **Waterloo-level engineering portfolio** (technical depth, honest about tradeoffs, quantitative results) combined with **business school case analysis** (strategic thinking, decision frameworks, organizational design).

The dual focus on **engineering execution** (projects) and **business strategy** (case studies) reflects Ronniel's CS + Management program perfectly.

**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy
**Build**: ✅ Passing
**Content**: ✅ Complete
**Styling**: ✅ Consistent
**Links**: ✅ Working
